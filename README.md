# True-WeatherC-
Lightweight weather app written in c#. This is an ongoing project. 


#Background
I started to learn C# by reading books. Then after a couple of chapters, I realized that I was just learning things I already know in a different syntax.

So I decided to learn by doing. This is my first meaningful program in C#.

I know there are a million of weather apps out there, but this one has taught me so many things. I'm proud of it.

Feel free to fork or send a pull-request.
